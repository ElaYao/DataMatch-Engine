# Python-Matching-Two-Datasets
Final group project repo for APAN 5210
In the APAN 5210 Group project, we build an algorithm to match businesses that were present in the left and right datasets. We were required tp pre-process the data, come up with a clustering algorithm, and then apply the matching function to the modified dataset.
