# 🚀 DataMatch Engine

**DataMatch Engine** is an advanced algorithmic framework designed to identify and match business entities across disparate datasets. Developed as part of the APAN 5210 Group Project, this system leverages data preprocessing, clustering techniques, and intelligent matching algorithms to ensure high-accuracy entity alignment.

## 📌 Project Overview

In the APAN 5210 group project, our objective was to develop an end-to-end solution capable of:
- **Preprocessing raw business data** to improve data quality and consistency.
- **Designing a robust clustering algorithm** to group similar entities effectively.
- **Implementing an intelligent matching function** to accurately link businesses between left and right datasets.

This approach ensures precise business matching even in the presence of noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent data.
